Meteor

What is it?

A real time node application that runs on the client and server.

You'll need to...

- Download and install Meteor by running `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`
- Create a new application with `meteor create myApp`
- Go into the newly created app directory and run `meteor`
- Browse to localhost:3000 to view the new app

Commands

Fire up Mongo `meteor mongo`

To deploy `meteor deploy ground-up.meteor.com`

To remove deployment `meteor deploy --delete ground-up.meteor.com`

To clear Mongo collection `db.things.drop()`

To reset the project `meteor reset` - Which also drops the collections in Mongo

Things to note

By default, to aid development, the full Mongo DB is replicated on all clients and all changes are propergated straight away.
