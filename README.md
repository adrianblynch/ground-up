ground-up
=========

To help demo the basics of Meteor to my colleagues at Code Club - Getting started with Meteor, I put togther a simple application with features commented out to progressively add extra features throughout the talk.

This doesn't highlight Meteor best practices, it's structured the way it is for demo purposes.

Meteor looks like a very exciting project!
